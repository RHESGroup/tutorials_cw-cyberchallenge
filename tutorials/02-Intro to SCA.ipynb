    "\n",
    "Side-Channel Analysis (briefly referred to `SCA`) is probably the worst enemy to cryptographic algorithms. In theory and in an ideal world, it should not. \n",
    ">Actually, SCA shouldn't even exist in an **ideal** world.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in practice, and in the **real** world we all live in, **SCA is one of the most efficient and suitable attacks you may want to use (or fear) against a cryptographic implementation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Citing directly from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack):\n",
    "\n",
    "> *In computer security, a side-channel attack is any attack based on information gained from the implementation of a computer system, rather than weaknesses in the implemented algorithm itself (e.g. cryptanalysis and software bugs). Timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks or even sound can provide an extra source of information, which can be exploited.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"trick\" to better understand SCA is to properly concentrate on the \"Side-Channel\" part of the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since most of us are Italian, let's not-so-correctly translate `Side-Channel Analysis` to `analisi tramite strade secondarie` or `analisi per vie traverse`. Should be clearer now, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the Wiki definition, an attacker (let's call her \"Eve\") leveraging SCA to gain sensitive information does not use conventional attacks such as cryptanalysis or brute force. On the contrary, she tries to find unconventional ways to leverage  clues one can only exploit in a real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "These clues are called \"leakage\", and are all physically emitted by **working** devices."

See the first page of the paper [*Statistics and Secret Leakage* by Coron, Naccache and Kocher](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1015047.1015050) if you want to learn more.\n",

    "Power Analysis attacks are successfully carried out if the targeted device is in close physical proximity with the attacker. Hence, the devices at risk are all those embeeded microcontrollers, smartcards, IoT devices, hardware access tokens, hardware wallets etc. that permeates our lives. **Basically, every device that can be stolen or momentarily tampered can be a target.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine Eve stealthy stole your personal smartcard to access the company's main building. Power analysis (or ElectroMagnetic Analysis, which is pretty similar) is probably going to be her goto attack to easily recover the secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Power Analysis works by observing and recording the power consumption profile of the above devices. There are two main class of attacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Simple Power Analysis (SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_analysis#Simple_power_analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this first attack, the goal of the attacker is (but not limited to) to understand *what is the operation* the microprocessor is performing. The attack is carried out manually: Eve visually inspects the graph of the power consumption and tries to interpret it. Pattern recognition tools and machine learning can be used if the attacker already knows what to look for. Most of the time, a single power consumption trace is sufficient (meaning Eve can succeed even with a single attempt).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Is there any interesting spikes in the current consumption of the device? Is there any repetitive pattern in the graph? **What useful information can we gain about the code executed by the microprocessor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Differential and Correlation Power Analysis (DPA and CPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_analysis#Differential_power_analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "> This class of attacks is way more complex than SPA, but also way more powerful. DPA and CPA allow to correctly guess the secret keys used by a hardware device. Contrary to SPA, **Eve needs to collect a multitude of power traces**, all referring to the same encryption/decryption algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "> To do that, Eve needs to trigger multiple times the encryption/decryption operation and record each time the power trace produced by the device. This may take some time, from hours to seconds, depending on the capabilities and on the hardware she disposes. As a rule of thumb: the more traces she captures the more leakage she collects, and the higher are her chances to succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Once all the necessary traces are captured, she can forget about the device (that may casually re-appear in your pocket \"Oh here it is, I thought I lost it!\") and proceed with the heavy-lifting analysis. This last step consists of statistical computations, able to refine the key research and finally guess the correct key bytes: more on that later."

From then on, the hardware setup used by researchers and hackers has remained more or less the same.
