    "Let me recall what I introduced you in the previous notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Simple Power Analysis (SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_analysis#Simple_power_analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this first attack, the goal of the attacker is to (but not limited to) understand *what is the operation* the microprocessor is performing. The attack is carried out manually: Eve visually inspects the graph of the power consumption and tries to interpret it. Pattern recognition tools and machine learning can be used if the attacker already knows what to look for. Most of the time, a single power consumption trace is sufficient (meaning Eve can succeed even with a single attempt).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Is there any spikes in the current consumption of the device? Is there any repetitive pattern in the graph? **What useful information can we gain about the code executed by the microprocessor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let me also add the follwing:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Simple Power Analysis is a preparatory step for Differential/Correlation Power Analysis. Most of the times, SPA is not enough powerful to recover the secret key. However, as we will see in the next notebooks, it is extremely important to know where we shall expect the key to be handled, by looking at *the code flow executed by the microprocessor*. Once this information found, we can properly tailor DPA and CPA so to increase our chances to completely retrieve the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "> SPA can also be used to reverse engineer a piece of code. With good-enough instruments, such as a ChipWhisperer, and some luck, an attacker can recognize the presence of branches in the code flow. Finally, with enough clues and some good expertise, Eve can go as far as to understand the single assembly instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it is called \"Simple\", but can also be extremely powerful in certain circumstances!"
