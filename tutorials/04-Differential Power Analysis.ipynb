    "1. [Differential Power Analysis (DPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_analysis#Differential_power_analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential Power Analysis is the first class of attacks able to retrieve a secret key (or parts of) from a physical implementation of a cipher algorithm. To do so, and contrary to SPA, DPA (and CPA) MUST rely on the **collection of multiple power traces** to succeed. A single power trace will not suffice. This is due to the fact that such attacks rely on statistical computations, which require multiple data instances, with the goal to extract the leakage (i.e. the useful secret data) from each power trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ÑπÔ∏è DPA (and CPA, which shares similar principles) are extremely powerful attacks: contrary to SPA, they don't require manual intervention or a visual trace observation: they can be made completely automated and, if the capture environment is optimal, can retrieve parts of a key in a matter of minutes or even less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the fact that both DPA and CPA leverage statistical computations, it is extremely important to remember the following: **As the number of observations (i.e. captured tracks) increases, so does the amount of leakage we have. Consequently, the greater the leakage, the greater the probability of finding the correct Bytes that make up the secret key. As we said in a previous tutorial, side-channel analysis is impossible to circumvent: given an infinite number of traces collected, Eve will always be able to find the secret key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> üìå The above point is extremely important for every Hardware Hacker: it tells you that, no matter what, **you will always have a non-zero probability of retrieveing a key, and that you can increase your chances of retrieving it just by increasing the number of traces collected.** For instance, if 100 traces give you only 8 Bytes out of a 16 Bytes key, 200 traces, with great chances, can give you (parts of) the remaining ones!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as a later remark:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Think about SPA as an attack focusing on **operation-related** observations. The goal of the attacker is to understand what happens during the operating activity of the target microcontroller, i.e. what is the algorithm under execution etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ÑπÔ∏è DPA and CPA are different, they achieve **data-related** observations, meaning their goal is to concentrate on the data manipulated in a certain instant of the operating activity of the target device. The goal is to retrieve the key (the data): the operation should be already known by the attacker."

This is why SPA is so important as a preparatory phase of the attack.\n",

Finally, she doesn't know what is the correct value of the result (`0x14` in the above image), but she can somehow try all possible values and relate them to the average power consumption obtained by analyzing all the power traces she collected. But how?\n",

DPA's rationale bases its assumptions on the existence of the same intermediate value within the real block cipher implementation, which leaves a \"footprint\" as a specific contribute to the power consumption visible in a power trace.\n",

    "2. We compute a score, to be assigned to this key guess: this score tells us how well the intermediate value (and hence the key guess) relates to the power traces! Basically, it tells us \"how close\" the footprint produced by the intermediate matches the footprint visible in the power traces;\n",
    "2. We repeat the operation now trying `0x01`, then `0x02`, then again `0x03` up until `0xFF`. Once done that, we should have produced 256 intermediates values, collecting 256 key guesses along with their respective scores (256 pairs key_guess - score);\n",

Hence the overall complexity is of $2^4 \\cdot 2^8 = 2^{12}$ in the case of a 128 bit key, and a complexity of $2^5 \\cdot 2^8 = 2^{13}$ in the case of a 256 bit key (as the outer loop iterates over the $2^5 = 32$ bytes of the key).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. You can increment the number of power traces collected: the higher the number of power observations, the higher the signal-to-noise-ratio and the higher the chances for the attack to assign a higher score to the correct key guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Instead of picking only a single key guess, the one having the highest absolute score, let's take, for instance, the first 5 highest-ranked key guesses. By doing so, we leave ourselves a few more chances to find the correct key byte. Sure we will now have more work to do in order to validate the entire key, but the process can still be automated and, more important, is still way feasible with modern computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Change the position of the target bit (e.g., pick the second bit, or the fifth) and/or repeat the attack many times, each time by changing the target bit, and combine the results together.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use a windowing system, i.e. observe the absolute difference trace in small \"zoomed-in\" portions, called \"windows\", that focus on a subset of all the samples collected (for instance, a window may go from sample 1000 to sample 1200). If we know where the `AddRoundKey+SubBytes` operations happen, temporally speaking, we can avoid considering other portions of the power traces that have nothing to do with this operation, and that may lead us to consider incorrect key guesses as correct bytes of the secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You are not required to implement all these approaches, starting from the second on (the first is actually quite easy to achieve). Consider them as a useful optional exercise, you can do them in your free time, nobody's stopping you üòâ\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If you decide to implement approach \\#3, hold on. You will see that CPA, which does a similar thing, will be faster and achieve better results!"
